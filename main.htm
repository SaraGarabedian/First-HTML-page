 <blockquote><pre>Cover letter 

    I've been wanting to become a skilled developer for a year and a half, since my current employer told me how empowering and rewarding it is, and have tried ever since.
    I used to be a teacher in my home country (France), in a military school, thus am very used to be surrounded by student aiming for excellence and improvement, which I am notably driven by.
    
    In 2018, when I met my current employer, I was initially chosen by him for my memory, determination, automatic organisation skills, and intelligence.
    
    I would now expand my skills as a developer, and feel like I need teachers and teammates, which I lack in my current situation, to do so.
    
    I am a quick-thinker, avid learner, earnest team helper, and have my former teacher's pedagogical skills, as well as learning capabilities.
    
    My ultimate goal is to become a highly competent full-stack developer, for I absolutely love the feeling of being able to create a beautiful program.
    
    How come you want to be a <b>software developer</b>?
    
    I am trying my best to learn backend Java programming on my own, however, my employer being a consultant, he doesn't have time to train me, and I've reached my limits of self-training. 
    For me to reach a comfortable level of competence, I now need skilled and professional educators, and teams around me, because being alone just got me so far.
    I am already able to write programs in Java, but I need tiny pushes to complete my functions or improve my coding style, which my employer rarely has time to help me with.
    I have no doubt that by September, I'll have a lot more training in Java, but I dream of becoming a competent full-stack developer ultimately.
    I have already dabbled in Javascript during my accelerated training in KTH, but very insufficiently.
    Therefore, your program would be ideal for me, already having seen Javascript, and knowing more about Java.
    And again, 5 months from now, I'll undoubtedly be a lot more comfortable at coding, thus capable of following the rhythm of SALT.
    Indeed, I already underwent an intensive accelerated program in KTH when I had barely any coding skills.
    There, I also learnt software engineering (notably UML), good Github practice, which I keep using for my personal programming, Agile methodologies (particularly Scrum), and appreciated how much more I improved, working with teams, which I now yearn for.
